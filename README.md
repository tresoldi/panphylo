# panphylo

`panphylo` is a free and open-source tool for converting and manipulating phylogenetic data, especially for non-biological datasets.

Many similar tools are available, both for local and remote execution, but
`panphylo` distinguishes itself for considering the usage in
non-biological research. For example, it includes tabular text as one
of its main formats, and allows to manipulate the data using pure
textual lists.

The library works by implementing an internal representation of phylogenetic data and a set
of input and output filters.

The name is a homage to the well know [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) tool
for converting documents, as well as a reminder of its origins as a
tool for doing phylogenetic research in stemmatology (Panfilo is one
of the protagonists of Boccaccio's [Decameron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decameron)).
